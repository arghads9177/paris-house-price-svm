# Paris House Price Prediction - Regression Problem

## Introduction

This project involves predicting house prices in Paris using a dataset created from imaginary data representing various features of houses in an urban environment. The dataset is ideal for educational purposes, allowing students and practitioners to practice regression modeling and enhance their knowledge in data science.

## Content

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of house attributes, making it suitable for building regression models to predict house prices. Each row represents a house, and each column represents a specific feature of the house.

## Description of Attributes

All attributes in the dataset are numeric variables, which are described below:

- **squareMeters**: The total area of the house in square meters.
- **numberOfRooms**: The total number of rooms in the house.
- **hasYard**: Indicates whether the house has a yard (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **hasPool**: Indicates whether the house has a swimming pool (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **floors**: The number of floors in the house.
- **cityCode**: The zip code of the area where the house is located.
- **cityPartRange**: Indicates the exclusivity of the neighborhood (the higher the range, the more exclusive the neighborhood).
- **numPrevOwners**: The number of previous owners the house has had.
- **made**: The year the house was built.
- **isNewBuilt**: Indicates whether the house is newly built (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **hasStormProtector**: Indicates whether the house has a storm protector (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **basement**: The size of the basement in square meters.
- **attic**: The size of the attic in square meters.
- **garage**: The size of the garage in square meters.
- **hasStorageRoom**: Indicates whether the house has a storage room (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **hasGuestRoom**: The number of guest rooms in the house.
- **price**: The predicted price of the house (target variable).
