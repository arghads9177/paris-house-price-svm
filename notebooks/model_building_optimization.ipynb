    "# Paris House Price Prediction - Regression Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves predicting house prices in Paris using a dataset created from imaginary data representing various features of houses in an urban environment. The dataset is ideal for educational purposes, allowing students and practitioners to practice regression modeling and enhance their knowledge in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides a comprehensive view of house attributes, making it suitable for building regression models to predict house prices. Each row represents a house, and each column represents a specific feature of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is available on Kaggle in the following link:\n",
    "> [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction/data]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "All attributes in the dataset are numeric variables, which are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **squareMeters**: The total area of the house in square meters. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **numberOfRooms**: The total number of rooms in the house. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **hasYard**: Indicates whether the house has a yard (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is binary.\n",
    "- **hasPool**: Indicates whether the house has a swimming pool (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is binary.\n",
    "- **floors**: The number of floors in the house. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **cityCode**: The zip code of the area where the house is located. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **cityPartRange**: Indicates the exclusivity of the neighborhood (the higher the range, the more exclusive the neighborhood).\n",
    "- **numPrevOwners**: The number of previous owners the house has had. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **made**: The year the house was built. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **isNewBuilt**: Indicates whether the house is newly built (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is binary.\n",
    "- **hasStormProtector**: Indicates whether the house has a storm protector (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is binary.\n",
    "- **basement**: The size of the basement in square meters. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **attic**: The size of the attic in square meters. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **garage**: The size of the garage in square meters. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **hasStorageRoom**: Indicates whether the house has a storage room (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is binary.\n",
    "- **hasGuestRoom**: The number of guest rooms in the house. This is numeric.\n",
    "- **price**: The predicted price of the house (target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Building**: Train the model with the dataset to predict the price of house in Paris.\n",
    "2. **Model Evatuation**: Evaluate the performance of the model with different metrics such as R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE).\n",
    "3. **Model Optimization**: Optimize the peroformance of the model to enhance the performance and decrease the error in prediction using cross validation and hyperparameter tuning. "
